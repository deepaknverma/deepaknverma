# Greetings!

I am a Sydney-based dad who, serendipitously, found his way into the world of software engineering. It took me fifteen years to uncover what truly fuels my passion, and interestingly, I resist being pigeonholed as a software engineer, cloud specialist, solution architect, or technologist.

In life, my focus lies on doing what I love. I thrive on constructing cost-effective, straightforward products designed to untangle complex business challenges. My enthusiasm for data is unbridled, driven by the belief that the solutions to all your business problems are intricately woven within the data your organization produces; you just need to know where to look.

I don't merely promise to solve problems; instead, I revel in collaborative partnerships. Working closely with clients, I delve into their products and business needs, navigating alongside them to discover tailored solutions that align seamlessly with their requirements and budgets.

My passion extends to cultivating autonomous and scalable engineering teams, recognizing the delicate equilibrium between individual skills and the right skills for individual growth. I understand that in the real world, finding both simultaneously is a rare gem. Building successful teams requires individuals with the right skill set, enjoying their work, committed to personal growth while contributing to the business's success. I encourage teams to fail fast, redirecting their focus from problems to resolutions.

I am fervently committed to leading high-performance teams and delivering innovative technology solutions that tackle real-world problems. With extensive experience in engineering leadership, I bring a profound understanding of the technical development process, leveraging technology for positive change. My strength lies in solving intricate technical problems and guiding businesses toward their goals through software innovation and best practices in design and architecture.

Having successfully managed and motivated cross-functional teams, I excel at overseeing complex engineering projects, from conception to delivery, ensuring they meet quality standards, deadlines, and budget constraints. My experience spans diverse domains, including financial sector PaaS solutions, B2B integrations, enterprise APIs, marketplace solutions, payment solutions, and CRM systems.

Communication is my forte, both verbal and written. I can articulate complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders with ease. If you're seeking not just a solution but a collaborative journey toward success, I'm here to embark on that adventure with you.
